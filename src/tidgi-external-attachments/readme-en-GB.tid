!! 🌟 Core Features

This plugin intelligently manages large files as "external attachments", creating lightweight "reference tiddlers" to maintain Wiki performance.

!! 🚀 Quick Start

```wikitext
[Drag any file] → [Preview info] → [Click "Import"] → ✅ Done!
```
* 💡 Auto-creates `files` directory
* 🔗 Generates standardized relative paths
* 🌍 Fully compatible with web deployment

!! 🛠 Feature Details

!!! 🖱️ Drag-and-Drop Workflow
* ✓ Drag files from any location (desktop/downloads)
* ✓ Auto-generates preview (tiddler fields/file location)
* ✓ After confirmation:
** 🗂️ Auto-moves to `files` directory (if enabled)
** 📝 Creates reference tiddler with `_canonical_uri`
* ✓ Intelligently detects files from `./files` directory:
** 🎯 References in-place without moving
** 📋 Perfect for batch imports with Tiddler Commander field editing

!!! 🗑️ Deletion Management
* ✓ Automatically handles external files when deleting tiddlers
* ✓ One-click move associated files to trash
* ✓ Keeps file system clean and organized
* ✓ Works with TidGi's automatic Git backups for complete safety

!!! ⚙️ Path Management Rules
* ◻︎ Default Mode (Recommended):
** → Automatically maintains `files` structure
** → Always uses relative paths (`files/example.pdf`)
* ◻︎ Advanced Mode (if modified the [[settings|$:/plugins/linonetwo/tidgi-external-attachments/settings]]):
** → Customizable storage directory
** → Absolute paths for external files (manual maintenance)

!! ⚠️ Critical Notes

!!! 🔗 Path Compatibility
* 🚫 Absolute path files:
** 📌 Local device access only
** 🌐 Unavailable for web deployment
** 🔄 Cross-device sync fails
* ✅ Relative path files:
** 📦 Supports full-platform sync
** 🚀 Plug-and-play deployment

!!! ⏳ Operation Timing
* 🕒 File movement occurs after "Import" click
* ↩️ Canceling leaves no residual files
* 🆕 Auto-creates directory on first use
* 🗑️ File deletion occurs when tiddler is deleted (if enabled)

!! 🔗 Extended Usage: External Links

!!! 📎 File Linking Best Practices
```wikitext
[ext[📂 Open Folder|file://./files/]]
[ext[📄 View PDF|file://files/document.pdf]]
```
* 💡 Must include `file://` protocol
* 🚫 Not supported on web version

!!! ❌ Common Mistakes
* Attachment fields (`_canonical_uri`):
** 🚫 relative paths Should NOT contain `file://` or `./` prefix
** ✅ Correct: `files/image.jpg`
** File links or absolute paths should be prefixed with `file://` (and usually you only use relative paths for attachment)
* Body links:
** ✅ Must include `file://`
** Wrong: `[Link|files/file.pdf]`

!! 🧰 Troubleshooting

| Issue                | Solution                 |
| Files not moving     | ✔️ Verify "Import" click  |
| Web version failure  | ✔️ Confirm using `files`  |
| Cross-device path fail| ✔️ Enable auto-move       |
| Files remain after deletion | ✔️ Verify "Move to trash" is enabled |
| Need batch import & edit | ✔️ Organize in `files` directory first |

!! 🌐 Cross-Platform Support

Close this plugin, and the dragged content will be stored directly as tiddlers, which is the most compatible way but will significantly increase the file size and slow down the startup speed. The following is a compatibility chart.

| Platform   | Attachments | Links     | As Tiddler |
| Windows    | ✅           | ✅        | ✅        |
| macOS      | ✅           | ✅        | ✅        |
| Linux      | ✅           | ✅        | ✅        |
| Web        | ✅           | ❌        | ✅        |
| Mobile     | ❓           | ❌        | ✅        |
