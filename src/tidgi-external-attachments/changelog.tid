! Changelog

!! Version 1.9.0

* ''Breaking Change'': Requires TidGi-Desktop version 0.14.0 or higher
* ''Architecture Change'': Removed `th-saving-tiddler` hook handler - file movement on tag changes now handled by backend FileSystemAdaptor
** Backend automatically moves external attachment files when tiddler is routed to different workspace
** More reliable - works regardless of how tiddler is saved (direct tag edit, draft editor, IPC call, etc.)
** No frontend/backend duplication - single source of truth
* ''Plugin Scope'': Now focuses on file import (`th-importing-file`, `th-before-importing`) and deletion (`th-deleting-tiddler`) hooks only

!! Version 1.8.0

* ''Feature'': Sub-wiki routing support
** Imported files now automatically route to the correct sub-wiki's files folder based on tiddler tags
** Uses the same routing logic as TidGi's FileSystemAdaptor
** Supports direct tag matching, tag tree matching (includeTagTree), and custom filter expressions
** Files are moved to the matched sub-wiki's configured files folder (based on WIKI_FOLDER_TO_MOVE_TITLE)
* ''Improvement'': Extracted sub-wiki routing logic into reusable utility module
* ''Enhancement'': Updated type definitions to support workspace service methods

!! Version 1.7.0

* ''Breaking Change'': Requires TidGi-Desktop version 0.13.0 or higher
** Updated API usage: replaced `window?.meta?.()?.workspaceID` with `window?.meta?.()?.workspace`
